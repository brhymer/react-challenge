# React-challenge

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a simple app built to take in an input string via a textbox and return results containing:
a). the number of each character in the script (minus whitespace)
b). the top five entries (fewer if the text is less than that)

The app is styled with Tailwind css

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
